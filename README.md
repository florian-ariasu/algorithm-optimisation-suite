# Efficient Algorithms: Searching, DP & Optimization ðŸš€

This repository contains solutions to five algorithmic problems, each requiring a unique approach, from dynamic programming to binary search. Below is a brief overview of each solution.

---

## ðŸ”‹ Server Power Optimization

### Approach
- **Binary search** on the possible power limit.
- Initialize `left = 0`, `right = max power supply (ci)`.
- Adjust `mid` based on computed power values.
- **Stopping condition:** `min1 == min2`, meaning we've maximized the power supply.

### Complexity
**O(log n)** â€“ binary search ensures efficient convergence.

## ðŸŽ¨ Coloring

### Approach
- Utilizes **modular exponentiation** (`fastPow`) for efficiency.
- Six cases based on `H` (horizontal) and `V` (vertical) positioning.
- Uses two **coefficient arrays** to store values dynamically.
- Smartly applies **multiplication rules** based on previous character positioning.

### Complexity
**O(n)** â€“ single-pass computation.

## ðŸ—œ Compression

### Approach
- Read two sequences and use **two indices** to traverse them simultaneously.
- Track sums with `sum1` and `sum2`, and use flags (`search`, `case1`, `case2`) to handle sub-sequence sums efficiently.
- **Two main cases:**
  1. Sum elements from the second sequence to match an element in the first.
  2. Sum elements from the first sequence to match an element in the second.
- If sequences can't be compressed properly, output `-1`.

### Complexity
**O(max(n, m))** â€“ as we traverse both sequences linearly.

## ðŸ”‘ Encryption Optimization

### Approach
1. **Calculate letter frequency per word** ðŸ“Š.
2. **Sort words** based on:
   - Descending frequency.
   - Frequency-to-length ratio.
   - Longer words preferred for ties.
3. **Select words greedily** to maximize encryption efficiency.
4. **Repeat for each letter (`a-z`)** and track the maximum encrypted length.

### Complexity
**O(NÂ²)** â€“ due to nested sorting and frequency checks.

## ðŸ›’ Optimal Offer (Dynamic Programming)

### Approach
- Uses **dynamic programming** (`dp[i]`) to track the minimum price at step `i`.
- Three options at each step:
  1. Buy normally (`dp[i - 1] + prices[i]`).
  2. Use a **2-product offer** (`dp[i - 2] + discounted sum`).
  3. Use a **3-product offer** (`dp[i - 3] + best discount`).
- Stores **optimal previous results** to ensure minimum cost.

### Complexity
**O(n)** â€“ processes each price efficiently.

   - `6`
   - `11 2 2 1 8 6`
   - `7`
   - `3 8 2 1 2 11 3`
   - Expected Output:
   - `4`

4. **Encryption**
   - Input:
   - `4`
   - `too`
   - `otter`
   - `tote`
